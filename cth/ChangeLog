2019-12-18  dshuman@usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: If permission problems stop the creation of
	cth_cluster.tmp, print more info and stop trying to create the file.

2018-10-25  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: bump up dendency on octave-cth to current version.

2018-10-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cthgui.cpp: rework how archetypes are selected. Now drag and drop name to
	              an one line edit box. There are too many archetypes to have
					  a separate file system tree for them all. This makes adding 
					  new archetypes much easier.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.3.14

2018-09-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: add in exp name to blank creation and removal.
	* configure.ac: bump to 1.3.13.

2018-09-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/rules: remove --with autotools-dev, has been deprecated and
	is no longer needed.

2018-09-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Fix bugs in larreflex one ticks. Change default file
	name fragments to improve clarity of what is actually in the .cth files.
	* configure.ac: bump 10 1.3.12.

2018-09-24  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Mod to get one tick bins working for lareflex. The
	intervals are set by SW, so they are all the same, which broke the one tick
	algorithm. Works now with just one interval. 
	* cth_cluster.cpp:  Releasing 1.3.11.

2018-09-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Fix bug, did not gen blank cths for lareflex case.

2018-09-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h: Add in elements for lareflex experiment types.
	* cth_cluster.cpp: And code to support it.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.11
	* Makefile.am: New version 37 .xls files for lareflex.

2018-08-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: fix bug for swallow files. Since we use the ctl period
	as the swallow ctl period, if there was a missing control cth, a blank
	control cth was not created. Now it is.

2018-08-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_impl.cpp: add in support of Include Flats In Clustering option.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.10

2018-07-25  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: add in KKH's swallow archetype .type file.

2018-07-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: add in creating a blank sibling cth for ctl/stim swallow 
	cases if sibling does not exist.
	* configure.ac: bump to version 1.3.9

2018-06-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: fix bug where program never terminated if missing
	swallow1 codes. Add in some helpful output as to the specifices.

2018-05-16  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cthgui.cpp: adjust the layout, the scroll right button was clipped.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.7.

2018-04-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: update octave-cth version to current. Accept no
	substitutes.

2018-03-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_env: add in Swallow archetype file.
	* Makefile.am: ditto, forgot it, need new version.
	* configure.ac: bump to version 1.3.6.

2018-03-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* run_cthgui: New release. Killer bug in this file, line to load a package
	was commented out.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.5.

2018-03-15  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump to 1.3.4. Preparing for package release.

2017-12-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: support for swallow. There may be more types to come, so
	this is referred to as swallow1 in the code.

2017-10-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: Move old tar file to /lab/SOURCES/old.

2017-07-28  dale@health.usf.edu

	* run_cthgui: new version of octave requires explicit package loading.
	* run_cthterm: ditto
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.3.3

2017-06-06  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: find bug in curve var. The R program writes out just 4
	bytes if there is no curve solution. The octave code expects the zeros to
	be the number of bins plus 3 for extra info. Now, if only 4 chars from R,
	we pad it to be the number of bins.

2017-06-02  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_env: mods for current files and env.

2017-06-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cells.pl: Ignore the below, mod to find the dir this executes from,
	which CAN be /usr/local/bin, or a local file...whereever, and use that as
	the path to get the other .pl files.
	* cth_xls2csv.pl: Modify to not print out blank rows. Some spreads have
	many rows with nothing in them, and it confuses people to see a screen or
	two of just commas. Only cosmetic, but keep the customer satisfied.

2017-05-31  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cells.pl: Modify this so it can run from /usr/local/bin. Confuses
	users to have to have multiple copies in local dirs.
	* cth_data.pl: renamed data.pl to cth_data.pl to avoid collisions with the
	real data.pl. cth_cells.pl expects this to be in /usr/local/bin.
	* cth_xls2csv.pl: this is a renamed xls2csv.pl which is installed in
	/usr/local/bin, for reasons mentioned above.

2017-05-30  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: find bug in how ctl/stim cths are normalized. Should use
	max from both periods, not per-period. All ctl/stim cth pairs must be 
	normalized the same

	Also, make the default # of bins 100, since that is what we always do now.

2017-05-25  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: remove default .xls input file. It keeps breaking and
	moving around and confuses people. Now an input filename is mandatory.

2017-05-04  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Bump up to 1.3.0 for release. This is the first version
	that includes archetype clustering.

2017-04-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Add in -v flag so experiements can be filtered by
	vagotomized, non-vagotmized, or not filtered at all.

2017-04-10  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_impl.cpp: Make Create Plots and Cluster with archetypes equal. This
	avoids having to first do a clustering run on the Octave size of things
	before we can do an archetype clustering operation.

2017-03-29  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: need to do a 1.2.9 release, forgot to depend on
	octave-cth.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.9. No code changes.

2017-03-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.8
	This version has mods to support creating and using archetypes. 
	An option to draw large plot and dendrogram windows for screen captures was
	added. 
	Additional help and tooltip text was added.
	* cth_cluster.cpp: Mods to support ctl and stim periods. 

2017-01-05  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: 1.2.6 release.
	* Makefile.am: Line commented out and should not have been.
	* configure.ac: 1.2.7 release to fix above mistake.

2017-01-04  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: We only need to write one *_to_r.txt output file for
	curve fitting since we put all the cths for all periods into it. Some UI
	output text added to say what is happening.

2016-12-20  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_project.m: catch error instead of exiting when trying to load bogus file.
	* cth_env: use symbolic links instead of making local copies. Files are
	rather large and user can't modify them from cth_gui program.
	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.6. Bug fix release.

2016-12-13  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/rules: hardening_wrapper stuff now handled by rules file
	* configure.ac: release of 1.2.5

2016-12-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.5, skipping few since last one to sync with
	octave-cth.

2016-09-07  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h: change MAX_CYCLE_TIME from 10 to 30 secs, MIN_CYCLE_TIME
	from 1.0 to 0.5 seconds.  Based on real data that is in the .5 - 30 range
	that should be included in the CTHs.

2016-04-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: remove pnppcth.cc, do not use it and for some reason it
	fails to compile on ubuntu (but does on debian, which has newer boost
	libs.)

2016-04-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: add in targets to automatically rebuild the demo .cth files
	if cth_cluster is newer.
	* cth_cells.pl: add to makefile, we need to go gen stereotaxic coordinates

2016-04-14  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: unversion the allexp_from_r.txt file.  It hasn't changed and
	it's a pain to keep renaming the file.

2016-04-13  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: add in install_missing_octave

2016-04-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_impl.cpp: very ugly hack to deal with spaces in dir and file names.

2016-03-02  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Notes for version 1.2.1
		There is now an Export To Atlas button in the GUI.  This exports a file
		that the atlas program can read [TODO:  this probably isn't true--what
		really reads in the info?]. The exported information is intended to be
		used to draw the CTH neurons at their stereotaxic coordinates and to
		color them based on what cluster they are in.

		The cth summary window was not drawing the one tick bin plots correctly.
		Fixed.

		The cth summary window did not work correctly on exported subsets of
		clusters.  Fixed

		If running the cth_project function in terminal mode, a non-existent
		function was being called. Fixed.

		The example oneexp-100.cth file contained all of the experiments, not
		just one. Fixed. If you have already created a working environment, you
		may want to run cth_env again to pick up the new file, or look at the
		script in /usr/local/bin/cth_env and copy it by hand.

		The file that contains all of the iterations of the curve fitting
		process has been moved to a new package, the cth-curves package.  These
		have not changed since 1.2.0 and it is a very large file to carry around
		in the cth package.  It is likely that the cth package will change much
		more often than the curves package.

      The GUI has been tweaked, as follows:

			The buttons on the left were rearranged so more commonly used buttons
			occur higher in the list.

			A -d debug flag was added that shows the Connect To Octave button.
			This button is almost always not needed and is now hidden by default.

			The high contrast color option and the 2D/3D projection options are
			rarely used and have been changed to checkboxes and moved to the
			Rarely Used Options box.  The high contrast color choice has been
			renamed to Color Blind Friendly because that is what it is.

         The GUI elements move around now as the window is resized.

			The size and location of the window and its maximized state is now
			kept in a configuration file in the user's home directory in
			.config/cthgui/cthgui.conf.

         A color blind friendly palette was added.

	* cthgui.h: remove unused pdist methods.

2016-02-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h: Add comment noting that the bdt time field is shorter.
	Code works, so nothing to fix.
	* oneexp-100.cth: regenerate this, the provious version used all the
	points, not just the ones from one experiment.

2016-01-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Move curve stuff to its own package, cth-curves

2016-01-15  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: bump up to 1.2.1

2016-01-14  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Release 1.2.0
	* debian/control: Depends on octave-cth >= 1.2.0

2015-11-18  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: add in support for R package creation.
	* debian/postinst.template: add in support for installing the local R
	packages.
	* install_missing_R: this runs as part of post.inst processing to ensure
	that we have all the R packages we need, including our local ones.

2015-09-29  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h: Add in support for writing and reading R files using a key for
	each CTH.
	* cth_cluster.cpp: Implementation of above.

2015-09-16  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_curve.R: modify how index into refit bins is calculated to avoid
	underflows.

2015-09-09  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: change PIE to PIC for g++ v 5.

2015-08-03  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Current list of files is in
				      data_files_for_CTH_cluster_project_v20.xls

2015-07-21  dale@health.usf.edu

	* install_missing_R: add in Rcpp

2015-07-09  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Many changes to support one tick bins.  Have to do two
	passes through files because we can only know some stuff after completely
	processing an entire period or file.

2015-06-12  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Create fake curve entries if there is not an input 
	from R curve fitting.

2015-05-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: added in xdotool as a dep
	* demo_1exp20.cth: recreated this, it did not have curve data in it, which
	makes cth_project.m very unhappy.

2015-05-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cthgui.cpp: 1.1.0 release.  Put in some text suggesting the curve fitting
	is not quite ready yet.

2015-05-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/control: add in R dependencies

2015-05-01  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h:  add in spike/amplitude calcs

2015-04-29  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.h: 
	* cth_cluster.cpp: add in unit normalization, 

2015-04-27  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: fix bug, peak normalization returned mean, not peak
	value (cut-n-paste error)

2015-02-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: major data output re-org.  Put all pt specfic info in a
	struct with field names instead of too many matrices assumed to be
	ordered the same.

2015-02-13  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_impl.cpp: pass gui window ID to our octave partner.  Allows multiple
	runs in different workspaces.

2015-01-26  dale@health.usf.edu

	* debian/postinst.template: add in mssing _ to some filenames.

2015-01-16  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: mod to be able to do debug or optimized build.  It REALLY
	runs faster when optimized.  You still have to edit this file to choose the
	build type.

2015-01-07  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cth_cluster.cpp: Really implement saving periods to different files.

2014-12-23  dale@health.usf.edu

	* cthgui.cpp: remove several of the distance algorithm choices.  They do
	not make sense for the CTH data, and one of them appears to be broken since
	it calculates negative distances.

2014-12-22  dale@health.usf.edu

	* Makefile.am: Turn this into a real debian package so it can be
	distributed to lab machines.

2014-08-19  dale@health.usf.edu

	* README: Some hints as to just what is going on with this package.

2014-08-15  dale@health.usf.edu

	* configure.ac: Start the ChangeLog, create this.  Going to 'debian-ize'
	the cth package.
	* cthgui.cpp: Move entire cthgui dir to cth dir, building recursive
	packages just too hard.
